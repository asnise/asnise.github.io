He had no power in battle, but he possessed the ability to 'devour' anything that fell into the void. The other gods ignored him—until only a few remained. They planned to kill him and steal his power.\nBut in the process, Irene—the only one Azzaria cared about—was accidentally killed. His rage drove him to devour everything. All the gods collapsed. He became something beyond a god.<br>\nFinally, he created a new universe, abolished the existence of gods, and freed all things from the bonds of divine power. He dissolved himself along with the past, leaving behind a universe free from the clutches of the gods forever.",
